# Assignment 3 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment completes our movie chatbot system by implementing action functions that query our movie database and building a natural language interface. You implemented functions to search for movies by year, director, and actors, as well as the core search system that matches user queries to appropriate database operations. This builds directly on the pattern matching work from Assignment 2 to create a functional conversational AI system.

## What to complete
1. Complete all action functions in `a3.py` (title_by_year, title_by_year_range, etc.)
2. Implement the `search_pa_list` function to handle pattern matching and responses  
3. Add at least one new movie to the database with proper formatting
4. Create a new pattern/action pair and add it to the pa_list
5. Ensure all provided assert statements pass
6. Complete the reflection questions below
7. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions

1. What are some key programming concepts or techniques that you learned while completing this assignment?
While completing this assignment, I learned how to find the different results when the codes are defining different topics. I learned how to change the functions to give back the result that the function is trying to find. I also learned that most of the funtions are going to be made in the same order using the same type of code, but the outcomes are going to be different.


2. How does the overall movie chatbot system work? Explain the flow from when a user types a query to when they receive an answer.



3. What are some real-world applications where this type of pattern-matching chatbot system could be useful? How might you extend or improve this system for practical use?
